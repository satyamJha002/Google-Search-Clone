# Google Search Clone 

1. I have made a Google search clone in which this app can also search anything and you will get all the information
related to your search input
2. I have used custom search API in Google search clone. This API is taken from the Google Cloud console where you
will need two API contexts API and API key. Both APIs will be found in your programmable search engine.
3. I have used ReactJS and Tailwind CSS to create a Google search clone.
